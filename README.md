# Red-vs-Blue-hat-puzzle
The Red Hat vs Blue Hat puzzle is a popular logic puzzle that involves a group of people wearing either a red or a blue hat. The puzzle goes as follows:

There are three people standing in a line, each wearing either a red hat or a blue hat. They can see the hats of the people standing in front of them but not their own hat or the hats of the people behind them. The hats are assigned randomly, and each person can only see the hats of the people in front of them.

The objective of the puzzle is for the people to guess the color of their own hat based on the hats they see in front of them, while minimizing the number of incorrect guesses.

Here is a possible solution to the Red Hat vs Blue Hat puzzle:

Start with the person at the back of the line. They can see the hats of the two people in front of them.

The person at the back of the line should count the number of red hats they see. If they see an odd number of red hats, they will say "red." If they see an even number of red hats, they will say "blue."

The second person in line, who can see only the hat of the person in front of them, should count the number of red hats they see in front of them (excluding their own hat).

Based on the count of red hats they see, the second person can deduce the color of their own hat. If the count is odd, they will say the opposite color of the hat they see. If the count is even, they will say the same color as the hat they see.

The person at the front of the line, who can see only the hat of the person in front of them, will follow the same strategy as the second person.

By following this strategy, the people in the line can maximize the number of correct guesses. However, it is important to note that at least one person will guess incorrectly if the number of red and blue hats is not balanced.
